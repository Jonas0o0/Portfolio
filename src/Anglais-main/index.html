        <h1>Impact of technology on the environment </h1>
        <p>According to different studies, the technology has really impacted the environment.<br>
            Among those impacts, there’s:<br>
            Salinization, acidification, erosion or desertification of the soils. <br>
            Technology also participates in the climate changes and affect the biodiversity. <br>
            We can deduct that the technology has a very bad impact on the environment</p>

        <h1>Concept of biomimicry :</h1>
        <p>Biomimicry is of taking inspiration from natural solutions adopted by evolution to use them for the human engineering. <br>
            Approach consists of prioritizing choices done by nature in the framework of sustainable development.
            Among all those choices we can cite : <br><br>
            
            - The Shinkansen : In order to limit the noise when passing through the tunnels, the engineer was inspired by the kingfisher. <br><br>
            
            - syringes Nanopass33 : Those was created inspired by mosquito’s proboscis. <br>
            The syringe are therefore painless. <br><br>
            
            - Velcro : Velcro strip mimic the burdock, a plant whose fruit can hang on on several surfaces.</p>
